# The Network

"The Network" is the collection of cooperating [[Sovereigns]]. It is an emergent thing, created out of the missions and actions of each and every Sovereign as all the Sovereigns interact with each other and the world.

The Network delegates (or in another way of speaking, is comprised so that) almost all of the functions that coordinate Sovereigns are fulfilled by Sovereigns.

That is, there is _very_ little overhead function in The Network; Sovereigns perform that, rather than any centralized individual or group.

(Sovereigns themselves will have internal overhead functions, or will outsource them to other Sovereigns, as do any other sorts of organizations, but not The Network.)
