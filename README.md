# Massive Decentralization

In a collective ecosystem of collectives of collectives, how can humans and decentralized organizations following the principle of subsidiarity connect and coordinate?  What patterns allow us to be strong and flexible enough to respond effectively to local and global challenges?

**Massive Decentralization** maps one of a number of possible cooperating architectures for human-centered decentralization and federation. Since decentralization itself must be decentralized, we believe this is one way, but not the only way, to decentralize.

Massive Decentralization is part of the [Massive Human Intelligence Project](https://massivehumanintelligence.org/), which is organized by [Peter Kaminski](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).

We propose the following (draft, 2022-05-25):

- [[The Network]] is composed of coordinating Sovereigns.
- [[Sovereigns]] are autonomous individual humans, or groups of humans, who together comprise The Network.
- Sovereigns publish statements of [[Purpose]] and [[Principles]]. They write their own statements or declare agreement with those of another Sovereign.
- Sovereigns [[Federate]]:
	- Sovereigns communicate about their mission and projects, and the statuses thereof, in simple formats defined by The Network.
	- Sovereigns make [[Commitments]] with other Sovereigns and strive to keep them.
	- Sovereigns request guidance from other Sovereigns when they want to coordinate or overcome blocks to progress.
	- To be part of The Network, sovereigns are willing to be listed in The Network'sÂ directories.
