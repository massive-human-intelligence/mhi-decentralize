# Massive Decentralization

In a collective ecosystem of collectives of collectives, how can humans and decentralized organizations following the principle of subsidiarity connect and coordinate?  What patterns allow us to be strong and flexible enough to respond effectively to local and global challenges?

**Massive Decentralization** maps one of a number of possible cooperating architectures for human-centered decentralization and federation. Since decentralization itself must be decentralized, we believe this is one way, but not the only way, to decentralize.

We propose the following (draft, 2022-05-24):

-   [[The Network]] is composed of coordinating [[Sovereigns]].
-   To participate, you're autonomous and sovereign (either as an individual or group). (We will use _"you"_ for both individuals and groups.)
-   As a Sovereign, you publish your own statement of overarching purpose, and beliefs in the ways of being together in the network, or state agreement with or ratify a publicly-maintained statement.  Align with what you wish; you just need to be transparent. Your statements and actions as a Sovereign will be taken as other Sovereigns to understand how you are aligned or not with them and with The Network.
-   You communicate your mission and your projects, and the statuses thereof, in simple formats defined by The Network.
-   You're willing to be listed The Network's directories.
-   You are able to make [[Commitments]] with other Sovereigns and strive to keep them.
-   You request guidance from other Sovereigns when you want to coordinate or overcome blocks to progress.
