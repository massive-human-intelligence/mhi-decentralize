# Massive Decentralization

In a collective ecosystem of collectives of collectives, how can humans and decentralized organizations following the principle of subsidiarity connect and coordinate?  What patterns allow us to be strong and flexible enough to respond effectively to local and global challenges?

**Massive Decentralization** maps one of a number of possible cooperating architectures for human-centered decentralization and federation. Since decentralization itself must be decentralized, we believe this is one way, but not the only way, to decentralize.

Massive Decentralization is part of the [Massive Human Intelligence Project](https://massivehumanintelligence.org/).

We propose the following (draft, 2022-05-24):

- [[The Network]] is composed of coordinating [[Sovereigns]].
- Sovereigns are autonomous entities (either individual humans or groups of humans; we will use _"you"_ for both individuals and groups) who together comprise The Network.
- Sovereigns publish a [[Statement of Purpose]] and a [[Statement of Principles]]. They write their own statements or declare agreement with those of another Sovereign.
- Sovereigns communicate their mission and your projects, and the statuses thereof, in simple formats defined by The Network.
- You're willing to be listed The Network'sÂ directories.
- You are able to make [[Commitments]] with other Sovereigns and strive to keep them.
- You request guidance from other Sovereigns when you want to coordinate or overcome blocks to progress.
